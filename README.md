#Data Scientist Challenge

##

First off, thanks for this opportunity, I had alot of fun! There were some frustrating parts (especially reading academic papers and conducting lit. review that I haven't done since thesis a few years back). But it was growing pain and I'm always interested in learning something new!

I tried my best to emulate the MRP process, adding my own twist and flair. I'm not too much of a theoretical person, 
so it took me a while to understand the theoretical underpinnings of MRP and how to apply it. So hopefully, I did it right!

##Notes

Just some notes that I want you to be aware of when you clone this repo.

* The ``.csv`` files will not be there due to a previous conversation we had regarding it.
* My deliverables to you will the ``summary.html`` and the ``index.html`` file.
* In terms of folders, here's a short summary of their contents:
  + ``census``: census files for post-stratification
  + ``lit-review``: papers on MRP and some test code
  + ``maps``: maps to visualize results
  +  ``source``: files sent to me for this exercise
* For some reason, Chrome doesn't execute the ``index.html`` file correctly, so you can either try:
  + opening the file in Mozilla
  + running a local server (I find running ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer``` to be the simplest)
* If there is anything else I missed or if there is something you want to discuss much more in-depth, please feel free to reach out to [me](minh.v.mai@gmail.com).
